# computer-networks-project
📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on a practical and in-depth analysis of the TCP/IP protocol suite, bridging the gap between theoretical concepts learned in the "Computer Networks" course and real-world application. The project simulates end-to-end network traffic, starting from data generation at the Application Layer, through the encapsulation processes across various layers, to the transmission and analysis of packets in a real network environment.

🎯 Project Goals
Layer Model Understanding: Visual and programmatic demonstration of data flow within the TCP/IP model.

Traffic Simulation: Creating traffic scenarios that simulate common network services (e.g., HTTP, DNS).

Network Analysis: Using advanced monitoring tools (Wireshark) to decode protocols, troubleshoot issues, and measure performance metrics (Latency, RTT).

Network App Development: (Advanced phases) Implementing Client-Server architecture using Python Sockets.
